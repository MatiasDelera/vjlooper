# VjLooper

VjLooper is a Blender add-on that generates procedural animations using configurable signals and presets.

## Installation
1. Copy the add-on folder into Blender's add-ons directory (`scripts/addons`).
2. Enable "VjLooper" from Blender's preferences.

## Basic Usage
- Select an object and create signals from the "VjLooper" panel in the sidebar.
- Configure signal type, amplitude, frequency and other parameters.
- Optionally save and load signal presets.

## Randomize Signals
Each animation has fields "Amp Min", "Amp Max", "Freq Min" and "Freq Max".
Set these ranges and press **Randomize** to assign random amplitude and frequency values within them.
